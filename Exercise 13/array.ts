let transport = ["bicycles", "cars", "buses"];

console.log(`I like riding ${transport[0]}.`);
console.log(`I like ${transport[1]} because they are a lot safer in heavy traffic.`);
console.log(`${transport[2].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + transport[2].slice(1,5)} are more time consuming but they are cheap and good for long travels.`);

// Done.
