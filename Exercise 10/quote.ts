// quote.js from Exercise 5
// by Abdul Hadi Faisal

let person : string = "Muhammad Ali"; // storing the name of favourite personality in a variable
let quote : string = "It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe.";
// the above line of code stores the quote said by the personality


console.log(`${person} once said, "${quote}"`); // prints the message using the variables "person" and "quote"

// Done.
